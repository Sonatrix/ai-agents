# AI Agents in Python WIP

This repository contains examples and implementations of AI agents built in Python. AI agents are autonomous software entities that can perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals.

## Overview

AI agents in Python can be implemented using various approaches and frameworks:

- Rule-based agents
- Learning agents (using machine learning)
- Goal-based agents
- Utility-based agents

## Key Features

- Environment interaction
- Decision making capabilities
- Learning and adaptation
- Goal-oriented behavior
- State management

## Common Use Cases

- Automated task execution
- Game playing agents
- Chatbots and virtual assistants
- Trading bots
- Recommendation systems

## Getting Started

To create AI agents in Python, you'll need:

1. Python 3.7+
2. Relevant libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenAI Gym)
3. Understanding of AI/ML concepts
4. Basic programming skills

## Examples

Check out the examples in this repository to learn how to implement different types of AI agents using Python.
